# BMI Comparison

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

## Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable `markHigherBMI` containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

## Test data:
### Data 1:
- Mark's weight: 78 kg
- Mark's height: 1.69 m
- John's weight: 92 kg
- John's height: 1.95 m

### Data 2:
- Mark's weight: 95 kg
- Mark's height: 1.88 m
- John's weight: 85 kg
- John's height: 1.76 m
