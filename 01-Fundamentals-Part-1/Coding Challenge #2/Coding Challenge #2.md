# Coding Challenge #2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

## Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
   - Hint: Use an if/else statement

## Test data:
### Data 1:
- Mark's weight: 78 kg
- Mark's height: 1.69 m
- John's weight: 92 kg
- John's height: 1.95 m

### Data 2:
- Mark's weight: 95 kg
- Mark's height: 1.88 m
- John's weight: 85 kg
- John's height: 1.76 m
